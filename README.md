# Question Answering for Node.js

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/question-answering.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/question-answering)

#### Production-ready Question Answering directly in Node.js, with only 3 lines of code!

This package leverages the power of the [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library (built with Rust) to process the input text. It then uses [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to run the [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)-cased model fine-tuned for Question Answering (87.1 F1 score on SQuAD v1.1 dev set, compared to 88.7 for BERT-base-cased).

## Installation

```bash
npm install question-answering@latest
```

## Simple example

This example is running the model locally. To do so, you first need to download the model and vocabulary file:
```bash
npx question-answering download
```

> By default, the model and vocabulary are downloaded inside a `.models` directory at the root of your project; you can provide a custom directory by using the `--dir` option of the CLI.

```typescript
import { QAClient } from "question-answering"; // If using Typescript or Babel
// const { QAClient } = require("question-answering"); // If using vanilla JS

const text = `
  Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.
  The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24â€“10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.
  As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.
`;

const question = "Who won the Super Bowl?";

const qaClient = await QAClient.fromOptions();
const answer = await qaClient.predict(question, text);

console.log(answer); // { text: 'Denver Broncos', score: 0.3 }
```

## Advanced

### Using another model

The above example internally makes use of a DistilBERT-cased model in the SavedModel format. You can choose to use any other DistilBERT-like model, either in SavedModel format or TFJS format.

_Note that using a model [hosted on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) is not a requirement: you can use any compatible model by passing the correct local path for the model and vocabulary, and skip the download step. In this case, you'll also need to provide a `vocabPath` when creating the `QAClient`._

#### SavedModel format

Download the model (here using DistilBERT-uncased fine-tuned on SQuAD):
```bash
npx question-answering download distilbert-uncased --format saved_model
```

> The `--format saved_model` is optional in this case, since the SavedModel format is the default.

> Any community model can be downloaded by specifying a `user/model` path instead of `distilbert-uncased`, as long as it exists a `saved_model.tar.gz` file for this model (containing the SavedModel version).

You can then create a `SavedModel` instance corresponding to the downloaded model, before passing it to `QAClient`:
```typescript
const model = await SavedModel.fromOptions({ path: "distilbert-uncased", cased: false });
const qaClient = await QAClient.fromOptions({ model });
```

#### TFJS format

Download the model (here the TFJS version of DistilBERT-cased fine-tuned on SQuAD):
```bash
npx question-answering download distilbert-cased --format tfjs
```

> Any community model can be downloaded by specifying a `user/model` path instead of `distilbert-cased`, as long as a `tfjs.tar.gz` file (containing the TFJS version) exists for this model

Then instantiate a `TFJSModel` and use it with `QAClient`:
```typescript
const model = await TFJSModel.fromOptions({ path: "distilbert-cased", cased: true });
const qaClient = await QAClient.fromOptions({ model });
```

### Using [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving)

If your model is in the SavedModel format, you may prefer to host it on a dedicated server. It's possible by instantiating a `RemoteModel` by using the `fromOptions` methods and passing it the server endpoint as `path`. Here is a simple example using [Docker](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/docker) locally:

```bash
# Inside our project root, download DistilBERT-cased to its default `.models` location
npx question-answering download

# Download the TensorFlow Serving Docker image
docker pull tensorflow/serving

# Start TensorFlow Serving container and open the REST API port.
# Notice that in the `target` path we add a `/1`:
# this is required by TFX which is expecting the models to be "versioned"
docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/.models/distilbert-cased/",target="/models/cased/1" \
    -e MODEL_NAME=cased \
    tensorflow/serving &
```

In your code:

```typescript
const remoteModel = await RemoteModel.fromOptions(
  { path: "http://localhost:8501/v1/models/cased", cased: true }
);
const qaClient = await QAClient.fromOptions({ model: remoteModel });
```

### Using a custom tokenizer

You can provide your own tokenizer instance to `QAClient.fromOptions`, as long as it implements the [`BERTWordPieceTokenizer`](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/blob/master/bindings/node/lib/implementations/tokenizers/bert-wordpiece.tokenizer.ts) methods.

## Performances

Thanks to [the native execution of SavedModel format](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/tfjs/Xtf6s1Bpkr0/7-Eqn8soAwAJ) in TFJS, the performance of such models is similar to the one using TensorFlow in Python.

Specifically, here are the results of a benchmark using `question-answering` entirely locally (both SavedModel and TFJS formats), using a (pseudo) remote model server (i.e. local Docker), and using the Question Answering pipeline in the [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

_Shorts texts are texts between 500 and 1000 characters, long texts are between 4000 and 5000 characters. You can check the `question-answering` benchmark script [here](./scripts/benchmark.js) (the `transformers` one is equivalent). Benchmark run on a standard 2019 MacBook Pro running on macOS 10.15.2._
